# weather_dash 🌟
This is a web application that displays the weather from different cities that the user searches as well as current location. The application uses the styling that I have used in other applications to showcase the my designer identity. The buttons use a similar approch to my Portfolio. 

## 🧐 Getting Started

You can type any city / location in the world in the search bar and it will provide you with a current day forecast and a 5day forecast for weather in Fahrenheit.
